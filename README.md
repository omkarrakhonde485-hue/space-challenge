üî≠ Embiggen Your Eyes Viewer: AI-Assisted Discovery
üåå Challenge: Embiggen Your Eyes! (NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025)
The Embiggen Your Eyes Viewer is an innovative solution designed to address the challenge of exploring and analyzing the colossal, multi-gigapixel image datasets generated by NASA missions (e.g., Hubble, JWST, MRO). It transforms overwhelming static data into an interactive, AI-assisted platform for discovery.

‚ú® Key Features & Innovation
üß† 1. AI-Powered Discovery Assistant (Gemini API)
This is the core innovation, moving the tool beyond a simple viewer into a research platform.

Instant Summaries: Automatically generates a detailed, contextual summary of the image's astronomical features (star types, gas structures, deep-field content).

Custom Analysis: Users can input custom queries (e.g., "Identify tertiary impact craters," or "Point out the anomalous blue star cluster") to leverage the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for guided analysis and anomaly detection.

üïπÔ∏è 2. Seamless Fluid Navigation
Provides precise control necessary for detailed scientific exploration:

Precision Zoom: Replaced discrete buttons with a continuous horizontal slider for fine-grained magnification control.

Intuitive Pan & Gesture Support: Supports natural mouse drag (pan) and touch gestures (pan and pinch-to-zoom) for smooth interaction.

Transformation Tools: Includes controls for rotation and horizontal flipping to help compare features across images or orientations.

üîó 3. Data Agnosticism
Allows users to load any public NASA image URL directly into the viewer, making it a versatile tool for exploring diverse data products (Earth observation, planetary maps, deep space imagery).

üíª Technology Stack
The project is built entirely within a single file for maximum portability and ease of deployment, utilizing modern web standards.

Front-End: HTML5, Tailwind CSS

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for image manipulation, panning, and zooming.

Core AI: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20) for multi-modal image understanding and content generation.

üöÄ Getting Started
The Embiggen Viewer runs as a single, self-contained HTML file.

Launch the Viewer: Click the "Launch Embiggen Viewer" button. The Hubble image will load as the default.

Explore: Use the zoom slider at the bottom to magnify features and click-and-drag (or touch-to-pan) to move around the image.

Analyze Data: Navigate to the "AI Summary & Discovery" panel in the sidebar:

Leave the text box empty and click "Generate Summary / Analyze" for a general overview.

Input a specific question to guide the AI's detection, such as "What is the age estimate of the globular cluster at the center?"

Load New Data: Paste a direct link to any high-resolution public image (e.g., a .png or .jpg from a NASA source) into the "Load New Data" input and click the button to switch views.

üí° Future Enhancements
For a production environment dealing with true terabyte-scale data, the next steps would include:

Tiled Image Support: Integrating a library like OpenSeadragon to handle dynamic loading of high-resolution image tiles, enabling seamless viewing of true gigapixel datasets.

Annotation Storage: Utilizing a database (like Firestore) to allow users to save AI-generated insights or personal discoveries and share them with a community.

Multi-Spectrum Overlays: Allowing users to overlay different spectral bands (e.g., infrared, UV) of the same object to aid in research.
